**Weekly Recap**

Once the apporpriate variables were gathered onto the excel sheet, they needed to be cleaned to help the analysis.  For example, to use the model to compare the number of runs 
scored between home and away games, there needed to be a variable that indicated whether a game was played at home or away.  While the original data set did not have this, R can be
used to insert such a variable.

In the orginal data set, if a team was away, there would be an '@' symbol, indicating that the game was played in a location other than their home stadium.  With this in mind, R 
iteratively went through each game played and marked it as home or away based on the presence of the '@' string.  This new variable was called "Home/Away".

Additionally, the data needed to be filtered so that all of the games were played within the same period.  A key condition of a Poisson model is that events are measured in a set
period of time.  For this project, a period is defined as a 9 inning game.  Therefore, any games lasting longer or shorter than 9 innings needed to removed from our analysis.

To start, in the orignal data set, the amount of innings a game lasted is represented by the variable Inn.  If a game occured in 9 innings, the value of Inn is NA.
