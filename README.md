# Honors-Project

Hello!

Welcome to my Honors Project Repository.  Here, I will be documenting my progress towards completing my honors project.  This will include any data sets I use, any code I use, 
and weekly journals where I talk about that week's progress.  The purpose of my project will be to investigate if the COIVD-19 pandemic had an impact on home field advantage
for Major League Baseball games. I will be building a Poisson-Gamma conjugate model to predict the amount of runs scored for a given game.
